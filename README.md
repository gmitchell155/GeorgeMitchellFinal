George Mitchell CSCI 4020 Final

This is my Final for CSCI 4020. 

The purpsoe of this application is to show potential employers my web design and app development skills.

This app displays local html files that are stored in the assests folder. 
There are three activities, each display a differnt site.

The MainActivity displays the main site with infomation about me, my education, and work examples.
An options menu is used to navigate to different pages. Two menu items will take a user to an example site that I have created.

The BagwellSite Activity displays my first example site. You access it by clicking on the Example Site 1 menu item on in the MainActivity.
It also conatins an options menu to navigate to the different pages. 
You can return to the main activity by pressing the Return to Main Site menu item.

The ClubSite Activity displays my second example site. You access it by clicking on the Example Site 2 menu item on in the MainActivity.
It also conatins an options menu to navigate to the different pages.
This site is a little difefernt from the others becasue it contains a two column layout.
I've kept this layout in order to reflect my usage of DreamWeaver.
You can return to the main activity by pressing the Return to Main Site menu item.

As stated this is a modified version of my online portfolio.
Below are changes that were made to make it more suitable for mobile view.

Css and HTML has been updated. 
Some CSS tags were incorrect and have been corrected. 
Some CSS IDs have been changed to classes since they are used multiple times. 
HTML and CSS has been changed to better conform to a mobile view. 
Navigation Menus have been removed from each page and replaced with a menu created in android studio. 
New PHP file was added online to handle user submissions and give user appropriate instructions. 
You can compare the files with what is online to see the full list of changes.

As a side note the contact pages will show an error, but they work. I supressed the errors since it seemed to be an issue with form labels.
